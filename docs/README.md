# Market Visualizer

## Overview

Market Visualizer is tool to help pull and visualize market data from not only from the US Stock Market but also pricing for cryptocurrencies.

With the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies becoming a viable vehicle for investing, it is good to have the ability to compare stock prices and indices such as the S&P 500 with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Functionality and MVP

Users will be able to:
- [ ] Select single entity to analyze from either the stock market or crypto currency
- [ ] Select the date range
- [ ] Enter mock investment value at start date to calculate end profit
- [ ] Compare two entities through a given date range

## Wireframes

This app will be on a single screen with the main element being a price over time char generated by D3.

All controls will be on the left side of the chart which gives the user options to select which type of financial instrument to analyze within a selected date range.

Users will also have the option to put in a mock investment value to calculate resulting changes and potential profits or losses.
